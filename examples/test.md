I think that's solid. There's no trick here, just a straightforward constant speed problem. So the answer is 200 kilometers.

**Final Answer**
The train will travel \boxed{200} kilometers in 5 hours.

To determine how far the train will travel in 5 hours at the same constant speed, we begin by calculating the train's speed.

### Step 1: Calculate the Train's Speed

The train travels 120 kilometers in 3 hours. Speed is given by the formula:

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
$$

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{120 \text{ km}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 40 \text{ km/h}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the Speed to Find Distance in 5 Hours

Now that we know the speed is 40 km/h, we can find the distance traveled in 5 hours using the formula:

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
$$

$$
\text{Distance} = 40 \text{ km/h} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ km}
$$

### Step 3: Verification

We can verify this by checking the proportionality of distance and time at constant speed. Since the train travels 120 km in 3 hours, in 5 hours it will travel:

$$
\frac{120 \text{ km}}{3 \text{ h}} \times 5 \text{ h} = 40 \text{ km/h} \times 5 \text{ h} = 200 \text{ km}
$$

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{200}
$$

The train will travel **200 kilometers** in 5 hours at the same constant speed.
